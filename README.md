# Basic HTML5 Exercise

To help recap/update your previous (X)HTML knowledge and get you started with HTML5, convert the module handbook Markdown file into HTML5.

- You will also need the 'html-css-js' image, changing the image URL at the top of the Markdown to a URL local to your HTML file.
- You need to preserve the semantic structure: e.g. one # sign is a level 1 heading (h1), two ## is a level two heading (h2)... 
- If you find this too easy, use some semantic HTML5 elements (e.g. header, aside, section, etc.) for some of the content.
- Use your text editor's search & replace function thoughtfully.
- Place the img tag and all other markup inside the body tag - NOT inside the head section...
- Remove the HTML 'center' tags - the tag is deprecated in HTML5 (and only used here as Markdown hack).
- Focus on HTML5 markup only - ignore how plain it looks (CSS styling will come later).
- If it's taking too long, trim off the bottom half of the table and delete some of the text paragraphs to shorten the process.
